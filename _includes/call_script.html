I am relying on the senator to oppose Fast Track.  The senator needs to choose sides on this one: If you're for middle class jobs, then you must oppose Fast Track.

Fast Tracking the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be an unprecedented attack on Americaâ€™s middle class.  It would make it easier for corporations to offshore our jobs and push down our wages by pitting us against foreign workers who make less than a dollar per hour!

<em>Will you commit to me that you will oppose Fast Track?</em>
